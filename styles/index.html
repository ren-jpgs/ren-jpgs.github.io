                        <summary>Why I love Parmesan </summary>
                        <ol>
                        <li>
                            It has such a strong flavor and the more it is aged the better it gets. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The cheese has a nutty taste that pairs well with pasta. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Parmesan goes well with cured meats like prosciutto, soppressata, or mortadella and green grapes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It has a gritty texture that feels like the equivalent of crushed peanuts in crunchy peanut butter
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I can basically snack on a whole block of Parmesan alone (sadly)
                        </li>

                <h3>Pepper Jack </h3>
                <ul>
                    <details id="jack">
                        <summary>Why I love Pepper Jack cheese</summary>
                        <ol>
                        <li>
                            Although it isn't such fancy cheese, it works so well in hardy comfort foods like a burger or sandwich 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Is not too overpowering, the flavors are subtle but are really great
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pepper Jack gives a little kick in the foods you put it in and can enhance the dish because of the little spices in the cheese. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add some to your mac and cheese OR breakfast omelette and you will transcend
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            There are probably fancier cheeses I could've picked for the last one but feta is so underrated especially in salads
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            add feta crumbs into an arugla salad with lemon vinaigrette or quinoa salad. reminds me of summer. yay!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            oh and I just learned this now but apparently it easier to digest which is a plus especially for me :, /

                        <li>
                            woah and it can also have health benefits if eaten in moderation how cool
